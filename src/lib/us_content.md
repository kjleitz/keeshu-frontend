It started in 2014, in April, on Beacon Street.

Aishu remembers meeting me on the porch. We were waiting for some mutual friends: our future roommates. She was already standing there, leaning against the railing, when I arrived at the foot of the steps.

I told her my name and she told me hers. She told me, months later, that the shirt I was wearing that day was too small for me, and it made me look ridiculous. Aishu, on the other hand, wore a long, loose cardigan, with black and tan checkers splattered across the fabric in an irregular pattern. She looked like a walking QR code, but she pulled it off. She can pull anything off.

She remembers our first exchange being on that porch. I usually defer to Aishu when memory is involved, because mine's a mess. Truth is, though, we _actually_ met a few minutes earlier.

I got to the apartment first. It was a triumph for me, the man who's always late. Fate wouldn't allow me the victory, though&mdash;I had no quarters for the meter. The nearest convenience store was about five minutes up the street, so I started up that way. A minute or so later, a girl appeared ahead of me, walking toward me. She was pretty. She had these big, dark eyes, wrapped in long lashes. She had a mark on her cheek, flowing black hair, a purposeful stride. I smiled and did one of those little head nods, the polite nod of acknowledging a stranger, an acceptable alternative to interrupting her thoughts with what would, inevitably, be an awkward and unnecessary _"Hello."_ She smiled back, and we passed. _That's_ when we met.

The apartment entered onto a staircase. Our other friends went up first, then me, then Aishu at the back. I already liked her. I remember walking up those stairs practically blind, my head turned back toward Aishu, making stupid jokes and trying to make sure she felt comfortable with the potential roommates she didn't yet know. I don't know if she really needed that comfort (she definitely didn't need those jokes) but I couldn't help myself. I haven't stopped talking to her since that moment. It just makes me too happy.

_She_ makes me too happy.

I proposed to her in the early summer, six years after that first smile. It didn't take six years for me to know, though. It took until I got to the top of that staircase.
